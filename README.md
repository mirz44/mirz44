## Hello 👋 I'm @mirz44

A web developer from Adelaide, working on apps/sites using PHP, WordPress, CraftCMS, ReactJS, and TypeScript. 

I am also a huge fan on building decoupled websites in GatsbyJS and NextJS, using the JAMstack and MERNstack methodologies.

Currently working on some personal projects to simply improve my coding skills in ReactJS, NextJS with TypeScript.
