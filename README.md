## Hello 👋 I'm Mirzaa

I am an experienced frontend web developer specialised in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WordPress, PHP, React, NextJS and TypeScript.
Currently obsessed with web animations and am improving my skills using CSS/SVG animations, GSAP, Framer Motion and other animation libraries.

I am also working on my portfolio website and also a personal blog with some technical posts. Hoping to complete these sites soon.
